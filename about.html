      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hello there! My name is Elizabeth and I am a junior in high school. Currently, I doing a software engineering internship, which is why I made this website. In the future, I want to be a software engineer. At school, my favorite subjects are computer science and Spanish. After school, I am an editor-in-chief of Fine Lines, my school's art magazine. When I am not doing school, you can probably find me drawing something in my sketchbook, practicing violin, or playing tennis. Thanks for reading!</p>
